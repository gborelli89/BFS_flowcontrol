# flowControl_GA

This repository is part of a PhD. study on passive flow control behind a step using circular cylinders. A wind tunnel is being used for the studies. All the codes are developed in Julia language. Notebooks are provided with the explanation of the codes as well as some examples. 

The main goal is to find good positions for the control cylinders in order to increase step's base pressure. A genetic algorithm was developed to decrease tests duration. A mechanical system with stepper motors controlled by an Arduino's Mega 2560 board was designed.
